The dataset consists of loan application information including features like Gender, Marital status, Dependents, Education, 
Self-employed status, Applicant Income, Coapplicant Income, Loan Amount, Loan Amount Term, Credit History, Property Area, and Loan Status. 
The goal is to predict the Loan Status (whether it's approved or not) based on the given features.This is a supervised learning problem, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
algorithm can be applied to classify the loan applications into two classes: approved (Y) and not approved (N). SVM aims to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates the 
classes in the feature space.Before applying SVM, data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features may 
be necessary. After preprocessing, the dataset can be split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
